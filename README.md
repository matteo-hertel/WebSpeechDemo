WebSpeechDemo Breaking Bad Style

## Why?
I was reading a [blog post](https://davidwalsh.name/speech-recognition) and I wanted to test that out, I also remembered that modern browsers have text-to-speech built in so I wanted to combine both!

## Instruction
if you saw Breaking Bad (if you didn't you should be ashamed of yourself) you know the answer to the question the browser will ask you!

1. click on the Heisenberg image
2. wait for the browser to say something
    - the browser will ask permission to use your microphone
3. answer the question
4. the browser will reply back both if you gave the correct or wrong answer

## Browser support
I wanted to build something quickly so it works only chrome (desktop and mobile)

## Contributing
PR's are always more than welcome!

## Stack
There are no JS frameworks involved, however I've added TypeScript and Webpack as build tool
